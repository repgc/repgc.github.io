        <p> This is the first project I competed with in the Fashion Scholarship Fund. Mizzou is a member school within the Fashion Scholarship Fund, 
            which allows students to compete. For this project, I was tasked with picking one publicly traded company (Lululemon) and one organization that 
            was not publicly traded (Disabled Sports USA). The goal was to create a collaboration between these two companies by making a product as well as 
            creating the marketing, financial, and scale-up plan. The reason why I chose Lululemon and Disabled Sports USA to collaborate was because people 
            with physical disabilities do not have many options when it comes to athletic clothing. The collaboration would help break this barrier for people 
            with physical disabilities as well as helping Lululemon to grow their target market.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though I did not win a scholarship from this project, I was able to learn a lot about the community of athletes with physical disabilities. 
            Because of this project, I have started to think more inclusively about clothing and how items could be adapted in order to function for everyone.

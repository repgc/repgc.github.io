        <p> The internship that I had in Summer 2021 was a Business Analyst/ IT Project Management Internship with Hallmark. During the internship, 
            I worked with both project managers to collect and provide information in order to prioritize projects in corporate small effort initiatives. 
            Also, I worked with the business analysts to gather business requirements from key stakeholders to understand architecture of projects. 
            In addition, I audited business process requirements to solution deliverables to ensure cohesive alignment through the project landscape. 
            During the program, interns also learned about Hallmark as a company, what they stand for, and the culture of the company.   
        </p>
        <p>
            The internship was a great learning experience for me since it was a digital position for a retail company. I was able to strengthen 
            my communication and leadership skills within the internship since I learnt about many different projects and met with a lot of people. 
            I was very fortunate to have been offered the position and am grateful for the opportunity.

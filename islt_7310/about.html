            Hi, my name is Rebecca, and I am currently a senior at Mizzou studying Textile and Apparel Management with an emphasis in Marketing 
            and Merchandising. Also, I am receiving a minor in Business and a certificate in Information Systems. I will be graduating Mizzou in 
            Spring 2022 with my bachelor’s of science degree from the College of Arts and Science.

            I realized I wanted to pursue a degree in fashion
            because I was always interested in figuring out what colors/ textures went together best. Also, when I was younger, I would help my 
            older sister pick out what to wear, which made me realize it is a passion of mine. As I got older, I continued to gravitate toward 
            fashion. Since I am interested in fashion, I have read about many different fashion designers. My favorite quote is from Coco Chanel.
